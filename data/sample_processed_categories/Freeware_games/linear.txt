The game is a clone of the lesser known Červi (Worms) from 1993, differing in that the lines now have holes. Author is Filip Oščádal, aka Fred Brooker, from the Czech Republic who made this game, together with Kamil Doležal, for Commodore Amiga including music, sound effects and graphical background (worm speed depending on the picture). The game was written in Motorola 68000 assembly. The original DOS game is supposedly from 1995 and written in Borland C++. The title is in German language.
The game is similar to the game Tron, where players leave a trail and try to make the opponent hit a wall or a trail first. The game is controlled by only two buttons, to turn left or right. A key difference is that in Achtung, die Kurve!, players can turn and travel in any direction, not limited to the four cardinal directions.
The 2B4 team, led by keubab, has greatly contributed to the European success of the firm.

<doc id="290504" title="Beneath a Steel Sky">
Beneath a Steel Sky is a 1994 cyberpunk science fiction point-and-click adventure game developed by British developer Revolution Software and published by Virgin Interactive Entertainment for MS-DOS and Amiga home computers. The game was made available as freeware for PC platforms in 2003. Set in a dystopian future, the player assumes the role of Robert Foster, who was stranded in a wasteland known as "the Gap" as a child and adopted by a group of local Aboriginals, gradually adjusting to his life in the wilderness. After many years, armed security officers arrive, killing the locals and taking Robert back to Union City. He escapes and soon uncovers the corruption which lies at the heart of society.
Originally titled Underworld, the game was a collaboration between game director Charles Cecil and comic book artist Dave Gibbons, and cost £40,000 to make. Cecil was a fan of Gibbons's work and approached with the idea of a video game. The game has a serious tone, but features humour-filled dialogue, which came as a result of Cecil's and writer Dave Cummins's goal to find a middle ground between the earnestness of Sierra's  and the slapstick comedy of LucasArts' adventure games. It was built using Revolution's Virtual Theatre engine, first used in Revolution's previous and debut release, 1992's Lure of the Temptress.
It received positive reviews at the time of its release and is retrospectively viewed as a cult classic and Revolution's greatest game besides Broken Sword: The Shadow of the Templars. A remastered edition was released for iOS in 2009 as Beneath a Steel Sky Remastered, which also received a positive reception from the gaming press. A sequel was greenlit during the Broken Sword: The Serpent's Curse 2012 Kickstarter campaign, and was announced in March 2019. Entitled Beyond a Steel Sky, it was released on Apple Arcade in June 2020, with a Steam release in July 2020.

Players control one of a family of three grim reapers and are tasked with moving around an island of hexagonal tiles, killing creatures called Cuties in order to replenish their own life force.

The demo was further tested after the five-day meeting, resulting in the complete game being released during March.

Critics praised the game's concept, gameplay and addictiveness. The intensity of trying to keep the reaper alive was highlighted by some reviewers, such as saving the reaper's life by killing many Cuties. Some issues, such as the lack of special effects and enemies, were highlighted; this did not prevent reviewers from rating the game positively overall.

The groups compete for control of Tiberium, a mysterious substance that slowly spreads across the world.
Westwood conceived Command & Conquer during the final stages of the development of Dune II, and it expands on ideas explored in that title. Inspired by the events of the era, particularly the Gulf War, the team gave the game a modern warfare setting. The game contains live-action full motion video cutscenes, which star Westwood employees and a single professional actor, Joseph D. Kucan, who plays Kane. The Nintendo 64 port was developed by Looking Glass Studios.
Command & Conquer was a commercial and critical success, selling over three million copies and winning numerous awards. It has been cited as the title that defined and popularized the real-time strategy genre. The game was the first in the Command & Conquer series, which sold 30 million copies by 2009. To mark the 12th anniversary of the franchise, Electronic Arts, the current publisher and owner of the series, released the game for free in 2007.

<doc id="7239234" title="Dwarf Fortress">
Dwarf Fortress (officially called Slaves to Armok: God of Blood Chapter II: Dwarf Fortress) is a construction and management simulation and roguelike indie video game created by Bay 12 Games. Freeware and in development since 2002, its first alpha version was released in 2006 and it received attention for being a two-member project surviving solely on donations. The primary game mode is set in a procedurally generated fantasy world in which the player indirectly controls a group of dwarves, and attempts to construct a successful and wealthy fortress. Critics praised its complex and emergent gameplay but had mixed reactions to its difficulty. The game influenced Minecraft and was selected among other games to be featured in the Museum of Modern Art to show the history of video gaming in 2012.
The game has text-based graphics and is open-ended with no main objectives. Before playing, the player has to set in motion a process which generates worlds with continents, oceans and histories documenting civilizations. The main game mode, Dwarf Fortress, consists of selecting a suitable site from the generated world, establishing a successful colony or fortress, combating threats like goblin invasions, generating wealth and taking care of the dwarves. Each dwarf is modeled down to its body parts, organs, and tissues, as well as having a discrete mind and individual personality, including likes and dislikes, and possesses specific trainable skills in various labors, as well as short and long term memories to facilitate all this. The second main game mode, Adventurer mode, is a turn-based, open-ended roguelike mode where the player starts off as an adventurer in the world and is free to explore, complete quests, or visit old abandoned fortresses. The combat system is anatomically detailed with combat logs describing events like organs getting pierced, fat getting bruised and limbs getting severed.
Prior to Dwarf Fortress, Tarn Adams was working on a project called Slaves to Armok: God of Blood which was a role-playing game. By 2004, Adams decided to shift from the original Armok to Dwarf Fortress after the former became difficult to maintain. Adams calls it his life's work and said in 2011 that version 1.0 will not be ready for at least another 20 years, and even after that he would continue to work on it. The game has a cult following and an active online community. As there is no way to win, every fortress, no matter how successful, is usually destroyed somehow. This prompts the official community motto: "Losing is Fun!"

At the same time they learn about hunger in the real world and the WFP's work to prevent it.
In 2011, a new, socially interactive game was launched in November by the World Food Programme in partnership with Konami. The game, which takes place entirely on Facebook, is amongst the first games ever to feature a real world impact through virtual goods.

<doc id="3312994" title="Football Glory">
Football Glory (Fußball Total! in German-speaking countries) is a 1994 football video game developed by Croteam and published by Black Legend that became famous due to the many similarities with Sensible Software's Sensible Soccer. It was released for both IBM compatibles and Commodore Amiga, and later peaked as high as second in the Amiga sales chart.
In essence a clone of Sensible Soccer, Football Glory was a more laid back, and at points, a much more comical approach: apart from several new features such as overhead and heel kicks, it included several seemingly unrelated animations (including female streakers and hooligans with assorted police officers chasing them, toilet paper and firecrackers thrown to the field by the audience after a goal, and cartoon-like talking bubbles after a referee decision, after which the player was allowed to chase the referee), and various other little amusing touches, such as the snow-ridden field having a snowman as a corner flag and icicles hanging down from the crossbar.
In 1998, Croteam released Football Glory as freeware.

<doc id="24991555" title="Future Pinball">
Future Pinball is a freeware 3D pinball editing and gaming application for Microsoft Windows. The software is similar to Visual Pinball ("VP") and other modern pinball simulation applications.  As with VP's relationship with "vPinMAME," Future Pinball ("FP") uses partner applications to emulate original pinball ROM code.  In FP's case, ROM code is emulated by Better Arcade Mode ("BAM") directly, or via other tools, such as "Pinball Browser." Future Pinball was discontinued in 2010 by the original author Christopher Leathley, but in 2013, development was resumed via BAM, by its author, Rafal Janicki.  BAM features many new developments, such as enhanced physics, optics, and virtual reality support.
